This project is a personal portfolio created from a layout designed in Figma, with a focus on a mobile-first approach. The portfolio was developed using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, with the goal of providing an engaging and responsive user experience.

Creating this portfolio was an excellent opportunity to apply and refine my skills in React and Next.js, while also leveraging the benefits of Tailwind CSS for a modern and stylish design.
